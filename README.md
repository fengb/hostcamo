# hostcamo

This is [my hostfile](https://gitlab.com/fengb/hostcamo/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/dist/hosts?job=hosts). There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## How to use

Coming soon™

## Major features

* Uses `255.255.255.255` — guaranteed invalid, unlike commonly used IPs (`0.0.0.0` and `127.0.0.1`)
* Tiny script — less code is easier to audit
* Leverages git history — easier to track changes
* Uses the [Pi-Hole adlist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/master/adlists.default) — good enough for me
